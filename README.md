# Chatbot RAG Application

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot application that combines a retrieval component and a generative language model to provide informative and context-aware responses.

## Overview

The RAG architecture combines two main components:

1. **Retrieval Component**:
2. **Generative Language Model**:

The RAG architecture allows the chatbot to provide more informative and factual responses by leveraging external knowledge sources while maintaining the language generation capabilities of large language models.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**:
- **Knowledge Base Integration**:
- **Customizable Retrieval Strategies**:
- **Pre-trained Language Model Support**:
- **Interactive Chatbot Interface**:
